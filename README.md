Erland, a passionate Developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia.
With over a decade of experience in web development and open-source technologies,
I thrive on building solutions that empower businesses to succeed in the digital space.

Since 2013, I’ve specialized in crafting robust web apps and web sites
using PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, Apache, Nginx, and other core web technologies.
Beyond development, my journey has expanded into the dynamic realm of cloud computing.
I now focus on Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), leveraging cloud-based virtual machines
and load balancers to create scalable, efficient systems.

I’m also a devoted advocate of GNU/Linux and the open-source community,
always exploring innovative ways to integrate these tools into modern development workflows.
