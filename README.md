Erland, a passionate Developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia.
I help teams turn ideas into production-ready, scalable web products
that customers genuinely value. Over the past decade, I have led projects end-to-end
spanning websites and web apps, balancing usability performance, and ROI
from discovery through launch and continuous iteration.
On the infrastructure side, I design and manage resilient IaaS platforms using
virtual machines, load balancers, and CI/CD pipelines. I implement autoscaling and
observability on GNU/Linux. The result is a stable, secure, and cost-aware
platform that keeps your product growing.
