NAME
    erland - builds reliable web systems and infrastructure

SYNOPSIS
    erland [--build] [--scale] [--iterate]

DESCRIPTION
    Erland is a web developer based in Jakarta, Indonesia.
    He helps teams turn ideas into production-ready, scalable
    web products that customers genuinely value.

    Over the past decade, he has led projects end-to-end —
    from discovery to launch and continuous iteration —
    balancing usability, performance, and ROI.

    On the infrastructure side, he designs and operates
    resilient GNU/Linux systems using virtual machines,
    load balancers, and CI/CD pipelines.

    He focuses on autoscaling, observability, security,
    and cost-awareness to keep systems stable and sustainable.

PHILOSOPHY
    Boring, reliable systems are a feature.
